# Anime-Recommendation-System

## Overview

This project implements an Anime Recommendation System using various data science techniques. The system is designed to provide personalized anime recommendations based on user preferences and reviews. The project consists of multiple phases including data preprocessing, recommendation system implementation, text analysis, topic modeling, and dimensionality reduction.

## Phases

### 1. Database Phase
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and merged anime and rating datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted exploratory data analysis and created visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.

### 2. Recommendation System
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Implemented content-based recommendation methods using Nearest Neighbors. Extracted features, scaled data, and computed similarities.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Used collaborative filtering techniques to generate recommendations based on user interactions.

### 3. Text Analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzed the sentiment of anime ratings to gauge user opinions.
- **Text Classification**: Classified episode lengths and analyzed frequency of genre words.

### 4. Topic Modeling
- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**: Applied LDA for topic modeling to identify common themes in anime reviews.
- **Word2Vec**: Used Word2Vec for keyword extraction and similarity analysis.

### 5. Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of feature space, improving computational efficiency and model performance. This helped in visualizing high-dimensional data and identifying key components contributing to anime features.
